# React-Based Web Application

This project is a React-based web application that includes a counter component, a user data form, and rich text editors. The application utilizes Chakra UI React Spring, TypeScript, React Charts, and React Router.

## Features

### 1. Counter Component
- **Increment, Decrement, and Reset Buttons**: Users can increase, decrease, or reset the counter.
- **Persistent Count**: The count is maintained across re-renders.
- **Dynamic Background**: The background color level increases linearly (preferably using a bezier curve) with the count.
- **Reset Background**: Resetting the counter also resets the background color level to 0.

### 2. User Data Form
- **Form Fields**: Collects user data including name, address, email, and phone.
- **Autogenerated User ID**: Generates a unique user ID upon form submission.
- **Local Storage/RTK**: Saves user data to local storage or Redux Toolkit (RTK).
- **Unsaved Changes Popup**: Alerts users if there are unsaved changes when attempting to close the browser.

### 3. Rich Text Editors
- **Visualize User Data**: Displays user data in a rich text editor.
- **Formatting Options**: Includes options for bold, italic, underline, and lists.
- **Data Persistence**: Ensures that the data is persisted across sessions.

### 4. Additional Features
- **User Authentication**: Google Sign-In with safe private and public routes.
- **Sign-In and Sign-Up**: Implement user authentication with mock validation.
- **Dashboard Visualization**: Displays counter and user profile visuals using React Charts.

## Technologies Used
- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **Chakra UI**: For styling and components.
- **React Spring**: For smooth animations.
- **TypeScript**: For type-safe code.
- **React Charts**: For data visualization.
- **React Router**: For routing within the application.
- **Redux Toolkit (RTK)**: For state management.
- **React Quill**: For rich text editing.
- **Clerk**: For user authentication.
